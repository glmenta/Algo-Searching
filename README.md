### Search => Types:

Linear, Binary, DFS, BFS

### Linear Search
```
=> Sequential => find target val inside a list;

=> similar to looping thru an array to find matching val;

Examples:
.indexOf();
.findIndex(fxn(){})
.find(fxn(){})
.includes();

Worst case: O(n)
Best case: O(1)
```

### Binary Search
```
=> is there a better way to find a num in a sorted list?

Ex: [1,4,6,9,12,34,45]

=> Instead of going iterating one at a time; we can sort first (in this case its already sorted)
    => then check if that middle val is lower/higher than our target
    => go left/right depending on above
    => now we change the efficiency of our search; from O(n) to O(logN)
    => we basically made a binary search tree;

=> Storing data in a data structure like a tree is more efficient than linear data structure like an array;
    => "DIVIDE AND CONQUER"
